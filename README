# Fireworks Package Server #

This is a package server created by the [Fireworks Project](http://www.fireworksproject.com/)
that is to be fully compliant with the emerging CommonJS specification. See:

## Choice of Django ##

Django was selected at least as an initial starting point for both the ORM and 
the ease of initializing an admin interface. Discussion has not yet started on 
a final platform, though GAE has been mentioned.

## Playing ##

You can easily play with the system by taking the following steps:

- Download the project from github and extract it somewhere you have python and 
  django installed.
- Change THIS_PATH in settings.py to your install.
- Create the data directory: `mkdir data`.
- Set it up with: `./manage.py syncdb`.
- Run it with: `./manage.py runserver`.
- Go to http://127.0.0.1/admin to test it out.
